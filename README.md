Our project aims to develop a real-time heart movement detection system using Socket.IO, a powerful library for real-time web applications. The system will monitor heart movements through the camera and the data will be seamlessly transmitted to a web-based interface for visualization and analysis.

* **Health Monitoring**: The system can be used for continuous health monitoring, providing valuable insights into the user's cardiac activity and overall well-being.
* **Fitness Tracking**: Athletes and fitness enthusiasts can utilize the system to monitor their heart rate during exercise sessions, ensuring optimal training intensity and recovery.
* **Medical Research**: Researchers and healthcare professionals can leverage the data collected by the system for medical studies, clinical trials, and diagnostic purposes.
